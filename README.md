# Foodie Check

Foodie Check is a shopping app where we can add food to the list that we want to buy, and we can also delete it when we're done by clicking on an item on the list.

The app also has a Reminder that we can turn ON and receive a notification on the phone every 3 min to remind us to buy everything from the list.

You can set a Balance representing the amount of money you want to spend shopping. As you add items to your shopping list, Foodie will calculate how much
more balance money you have left.

You can also see the total amount of money you will spend buying all items from the shopping list and should the need arise you can reset that amount,
if you don't want to take into account previously added items that you deleted.

You can also edit the item name and price, and Foodie will update it accordingly.

Foodie Check is mainly built for mobile phones.
